# typescript-issue-1-checkJS
Illustrates a problem with checkJS when referencing a local repository.  [This project](https://github.com/lukewis/typescript-issue-1-checkJS) is referenced via a git-style reference in package.json, and everything works fine using the git-style reference, but things break when using a file system reference.
